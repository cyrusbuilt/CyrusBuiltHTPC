This project was created using VisualMicro for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (http://www.visualmicro.com).

** HOWEVER **
The Raspi_ATX_PMU.ino file is still a normal sketch, so it can be opened in the standard Arduino IDE or other alternative IDEs/code editors.

Dependencies:
PMUState - Simple device state library for Raspi_ATX_PMU, by CyrusBuilt.
ButtonEvent - Part of ebl-arduino, and Event-based library for Arduino by
Renato Ferreira (https://code.google.com/p/ebl-arduino/wiki/ButtonEvent)

Both libs need to be copied to the "libraries" folder in your Aduion installation.
